# FEA_Solver_MATLAB

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical simulation technique used in engineering and physics to analyze the behavior of complex structures and systems under various physical conditions. FEA divides a complex object or system into smaller, finite elements, which are then subjected to mathematical modeling and analysis. By applying principles of physics and engineering, FEA calculates how these elements respond to forces, heat, vibrations, and other factors. It provides insights into stress, strain, deformation, and other properties, helping engineers and scientists optimize designs and predict the performance of materials and structures in real-world scenarios without the need for physical prototypes. FEA is widely used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, civil engineering, and manufacturing for design, analysis, and optimization.


Finite Element Analysis (FEA) solver is a computational tool that simulates how materials and structures respond to various physical conditions (e.g., forces, temperature). It breaks complex systems into smaller elements, applies mathematical equations to each, and iteratively solves them to predict stress, deformation, and other behaviors, aiding in engineering design and analysis.


Here, a sophisticated CLI (command line interface) based linear FEA (time independent) solver for static structural problems for 2D and 3D systems is designed and developed using MATLAB. The logic behind the code is self developed is based on the theory of Numerical methods.
